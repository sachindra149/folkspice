						<p>Bird Eye Chilli is a chilli pepper commonly found in South East Asian countries. The fruits
							of this plant are very pungent, while the plant is a perennial with small, tapering fruits,
							often two or three at a node. These have their origins in Mexico, Central America and South
							America and were spread across the world by Spanish and Portuguese colonists, missionaries
							and traders. These are small in size but are quite hot, in fact, these are much hotter than
							the spiciest jalepenos.</p>
						<p>These are widely used in many Asian cuisines and are commonly used in soups, salads and
							stir-free dishes. They are also used in a wide variety of sauces, pastes, and marinades, and
							are used as a condiment or eaten raw, both fresh and dried.</p>
						<p>In North-East India, these are grown in Assam, Mizoram and some parts of Manipur and have an
							average length of 2-3 centimeters. The colour of a mature bird eye chilli is red, but these
							can also be found in purple, yellow and black colours.</p>

							<p>Bird Eye Chilli is considered as one among the ten hottest chilli peppers across the
								world. Birds love to pick the ripe chilli and since its propagation is done by birds,
								they are known by the name "Birds Eye Chilli". These are widely used to spice up food,
								which gives a hot and spicy flavor, due to the presence of capsaicin that
								creates the main taste of Bird's Eye Chili. It helps reduce weight and also helps
