						<p>Black Pepper is the most important and commonly used spice in the world. Pepper was
							introduced to the West after the 4th century BC. It was so preciuos at that time that it was
							used as money to pay taxes, tributes, dowry and rent. For many centuries, pepper was grown
							in a small region of India (in the Malabar region).</p>
						<p>The outer layer of the Black Pepper (known as the "pericap") is dark brown/black and wrinkled
							in appearance. From the inside, there is a large seed that is lighter in color. Black Pepper
							contains around 2-4% essential oils. Although it is widely used as a spice around the world,
							Black Pepper also has a medicinal usage (to relieve flatulence) and as a stimulant of
							gastric secretions.</p>

												The Black Pepper plant is a woody climber and can reach upto heights of
												upto 10 meters. Black pepper is produced from the still-green, unripe
												drupe of the pepper plant. The drupes are cooked briefly in hot
												water, both to clean them and to prepare them for drying. The heat
												ruptures cell walls in the pepper, speeding the work of browning enzymes
												during drying. The drupes dry in the sun or by machine for several
												days, during which the pepper skin around the seed shrinks and darkens
												into a thin, wrinkled black layer. Once dry, the spice is called black
												peppercorn. On some estates, the berries are separated from the stem by
												hand and then sun-dried without boiling. After the peppercorns are
												dried, pepper spirit and oil can be extracted
												from the berries by crushing them. Pepper spirit is used in many
												medicinal and beauty products. Pepper oil is also used as an ayurvedic
												massage oil and in certain beauty and herbal treatments.
