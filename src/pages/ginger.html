						<h3>English Name: <b>Ginger</b></h3>
						<h3>Botanical Name: <b>Zingiber Officinale</b></h3>
						<h3>Common Name: <b>Adrak</b></h3>
						<p>Ginger is a one of the most commonly consumed dietary condiments in the world. It is a member
							of a plant family that includes cardamom, turmeric and galangal. Its spicy aroma is because
							of the
							presence of ketones, especially the gingerols, which is the primary component of ginger as
							per several health-related scientific research. It is one of the first spices to have been
							exported from Asia, arriving in Europe with the spice trade and was used by ancient Greeks
							and Romans.</p>
						<p>It is cultivated in India and is used as fresh vegetable and as dried spice. It is obtained
							from the rhizomes of Zingiber Officinale. North-East India takes a leading part in the
							production of Ginger, where more than 70% of total ginger is produced. The region boasts of
							several varities of Ginger such as Maran, Nadia, Aizol Ginger, etc.</p>
