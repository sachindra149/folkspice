						<p>Bhut Jolokia, also known as the Ghost Pepper, is one of the hottest peppers in the world. It
							has been awarded the World's Hottest Chilli Pepper by the Guinness Book of World Record in
							2007. It
							is a naturally growing pepper that is extensively cultivated in North East India, especially
							in the Indian states of Assam, Nagaland and Manipur, and Bangaldesh. Growing these peppers
							are quite difficult as they like more humidity and heat. These are native to India and are
							best grown in Indian conditions.
						</p>
						<p>Ripe peppers meaure 2.5 to 3.3 inches long with a red, yellow, purple, orange or chocolate
							colours while the pepper plants can grown from 24 to 48 inches in height. Due to the
							extra-ordinary pungency level, it is especially suitable for the
							preparation of oleoresin capsicum as well as extraction of capsaicin (the chemical that
							makes peppers hot). These peppers have
							dented skin that is very thin and is easy to tear.</p>

							<p>Bhut Jolokia is the spiciest pepper all over the world. It has its origin in the North
								Eastern parts of India and is a very common name in the Nagaand Assamese cuisine. In
								fact, it is often said that the Assamese Thali (or the food plate) is incomplete without
								the use of Bhut Jolokia. The hottest Ghost Pepper or Bhut Jolokia is 416 times spicier
								than the a regular Jalapeno Pepper. It gives a deceiving sweet taste initially but after
								sometime the spicy taste sets in, leaving you gasping for breath and craving for sweets.
								People sweating profusely is also quite common. Also, this might create burning
								sensation in skin as well. Hence, direct consumption of Bhut Jolokia should be avoided.
								It is used to make Pepper Spray for self protection. People in North eastern states, use
								this pepper to keep the wild animals away from their huts.
							</p>
							<p>Though it is known for being one of the most spiciest peppers, it has its own set of
								health benefits as well. The heat from Bhut Jolokia can be used to treat sinus patients
								by clearing out the nasal passage. It is also known to bring relief from migranes and
								persistent headaches. It has anti-oxidants which prevents us from falling sick. It also
								speeds up metabolism which further helps us reduce weight. But, it has its own
								side-effects too. Consuming too much of this can cause upset stomach and also diarrhea.
