						<p>Bay Leaf is an aromatic leaf that is commonly used for culinary purposes. It can be used as a
							whole, either dried or fresh. In both cases, it is removed from the dish before consumption.
							It contains essential oils such as eucalyptol, terpenes, and methyleugenol, which contribute
							to its taste and aroma. It has a pungent and a sharp, bitter taste when eaten as a whole.
						</p>
						<p>The camphor-like volatile oil in Bay Leaf acts as a pest-repellent. This can be placed under
							cabinets and appliances, near trash containers, or even in dry goods' containers, such as
							rice or flour, anywhere there may be a bug problem. Bay Leaf is considered to have medicinal
							qualities as well, particularly to help with headache, arthritis, and digestive issues.</p>
						<p>Bay leaves must not be consumed as whole. These are very stiff and even after hours of
							cooking, these can cause damage to the digestive tract.</p>

								Bay Leaf is a common herb that has a long history of culinary, medicinal, and cultural
								usage. Laurel wreath crowns were long recognized as a symbol of honor. Now, people
								mainly focus on the practical uses. Fresh bay leaves have a different taste and aroma
								than dried leaves, but both work well in cooking.

												repel moths, flies, cockroaches and other insects. These are also known

												antifungal, insect repellent, anticonvulsant, antimutagenic, analgesic
												and an anti-inflammatory as well.
